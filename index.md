If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
